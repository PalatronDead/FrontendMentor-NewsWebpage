## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS

### What I learned

I learned how to use CSS Grid, because I knew the basics, but i had never applied them before in a project and this made me realize the potential that CSS Grid has over Flexbox, at least in my opinion.


### Continued development

Definitely, I would like to continue improving my css Grid and maybe trying out a CSS Framework to optimize my work.
